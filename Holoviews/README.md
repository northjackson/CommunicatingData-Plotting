# Holoviews Workshop

This workshp is a collection of materials adapted form the [holoviews.org](https://holoviews.org) python website.

HoloViews is a high-level Python library designed to simplify data analysis and visualization by letting users focus on the meaning of their data rather than the mechanics of plotting. 
Unlike Matplotlib, which requires explicit command calls to define visual properties (like axes, colors, and markers), HoloViews primarily uses a declarative API where data objects are combined and annotated with metadata, abstracting away the underlying rendering engine.

HoloViews serves as an intermediary layer: it provides a consistent, high-level interface that can seamlessly render visualizations using several different backend libraries, including Matplotlib and [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) - a UI plotting tool. 
While Matplotlib is a foundational, low-level library that offers maximum control and static output, HoloViews leverages it to  produce interactive or multi-dimensional visualizations with minimal code, making it an excellent choice for exploratory data analysis.

This workshop contains the following modules for getting started with HoloViews:

* [Introduction](./getting_started/1-Introduction.ipynb)
* [Customization](./getting_started/2-Customization.ipynb)
* [Tabular Datasets](./getting_started/3-Tabular_Datasets.ipynb)
* [Gridded Datasets](./getting_started/4-Gridded_Datasets.ipynb)
* [Live Data](./getting_started/5-Live_Data.ipynb)

Additional and more in-depth tutorials can be found in the [user_guide](./user_guide/)

Give the Exercises a go and have fun!
