    "# Exploratory Data Analysis Exercise with Pandas and Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you are responsible for devleoping a data pipeline to ingest and analyze multi-state streamflow records from CSV files in our Canvas Class. This exercise will directly assist with HW #1. Filepath for the data:\n",

    "    files -> Data -> NWIS_Streaflow -> <STATE>\n",
    "\n",
    "You will download the data from Canvas and load it into a folder you create called \"streamflow_data\". Once within the repo, you will load the data into this python notebook and perform exploratory data analysis. After performing data cleaning and time-series alignment with Pandas, you will transition develop Matplotlib visualizations. The core of the assignment emphasizes the Matplotlib philosophy, challenging you to use powerful operators to link, overlay, and explore discharge trends across Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming.\n",

    "Use the [USGS NWIS Mapper](https://apps.usgs.gov/nwismapper/) to locate one site below a reservoir,  one site in a headwater catchment, and one site near a rivers terminus to the Great Salt Lake. Using this siteid, find the site data in the Canvas NWIS_Streamflow data folder, download it to your computer, then upload it to this repo into a folder named \"streamflow_data\". In the code block below, load the data into a Pandas DataFrame and inspect it as we previously did in the Pandas exercises (.head(), .describe()). Write down what you notice. Remove any outliers NaN values, and -999."
